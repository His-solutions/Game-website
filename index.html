            <p class="paragraph">Games are activities or contests that people play for entertainment, learning, 
                or competition. They can be physical, like football or tag, or digital, 
                like video games and mobile apps. Games are not only fun, but they also help 
                develop important skills such as teamwork, strategy, problem-solving, and
                 hand-eye coordination. Whether played alone or with others, 
                games offer a great way to relax, socialize, and challenge oneself.</p>
